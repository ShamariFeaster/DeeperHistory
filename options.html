  <td> <b>COMING SOON!!!</b> Imagine being able to search the browsing history of on ANY  of your devices, using any device - even one's you don't own
  like public computers. Just sign into your own cloud storage account and search. Anything you see on the Internet will be instantly recallable. 
  This is the future of Deeper History.</td>

  <td>History Scan</td>
  <td><div><button type="button" id="scan_history">Start</button></div><div><input id="day_input" type="number" name="days" value="1" min="1" max="5"></div></td>
  <td>To have your history scanned into Deeper History (DH), and therefore immediately searchable, use the number selector in this row to
  select how many days back you want the scan to begin then press start. Do this when you have a strong network connection, expect 
  to be away from your computer, and network bandwidth cost is not an issue as it will actually revisit the pages in your history at 
  a rate of 2 pages/second. After starting the scan you can pause it by pressing the "Pause" button in this row.

    <input type="radio" name="power_button" value="Disable">Disable</input> 
  </td>
  <td>Disabling the power button here means you can't use it to turn the history tracking off/on. Pressing the power button 
  will stop  from saving information to your database about the pages you visit. When DH is  off, the power button turns red. When 
  DH is on, the power button turns green. The power button is useful to save space when you're browsing pages that you know you will
  not want to recall later.</td>

  <td>History Permission</td>

  </td>
  <td>If you started a scan and it did not complete because you closed this page before it finished or some other error, you will need to
  manually revoke the history permission by pressing this button. The history permission grants Deeper History access to utilize your
  browsing history for the scan.</td>
