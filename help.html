<p class="pad_text">Deep History <b>DOES NOT</b> search your preexisting history so when 
you first install it so initially Deeper History searches will not return result. You <b>CAN</b> 
have it perform a scan of your history by going to the <a href="options.html" target="_blank">OPTIONS PAGE</a>.</p>

<a class="heading" id="intro" ><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></a>

<p>Have you ever wanted to search for things in your history but couldn't find it? If the words you're looking for 
part of the page title or url, you're out of luck because that's all the conventional history saves. </p>

<p>Things like comments, quotes, names, email addresses, links and other page contents are lost in your browser history. 
Deeper History allows you to search for and recall the text of any page you've visited.</p>

<p>Search from your browser bar. Results are returned instantly. Pick a result and Deeper History takes you to that 
page, scrolls to what you searched for and highlights it.</p>

<a class="heading" id="privacy"><h3>PRIVACY</h3></a>
<p>Let's talk about what this app DOES NOT do:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Send your history anywhere</li>
<li>2. Analyze your history</li>
<li>3. Analyze your browsing behavior or habits</li>
<li>4. Keep any meta-data about you</li>
</ul>

<p>You will notice this app doesn't ask you for permission to use your history. Deeper History doesn't
keep track of clicks, how long you stay on a page, or ANYTHING about your browsing habits. </p>

<p>Deeper History keeps it's own database. Only the url, the date/time you visited it, and compressed 
contents of pages you go to are stored ON YOUR MACHINE. Not even other apps running on your browser 
are able to see this stored data.</p>

<a class="heading" id="performance"><h3>TECHNICAL STUFF</h3></a>

<p>Deeper History makes use of the time your browser is dormant to compress and store the webpages you've 
been to. I haven't recorded increased page loading latency but please let me know if you are and the 
issue will be fixed in future updates.</p>

<h4>PERMISSIONS </h4>

<p>Deeper History ask you to "Access data on all you websites." In order to allow you to search through 
your visited pages, it needs this permission to get the contents of the visited page for storage in your 
database. The highlight function also depends on this permission.</p>

<p>Deeper History asks you to "Access your tabs and browsing activity." Deeper History would not be able 
to open tabs for things like the result overflow page, help page or selected results without this permission. 
</p>

<a class="heading" id="state"><h3>STATE OF THE SOFTWARE</h3></a>

<p>This is a BETA release. There is currently only one person working on this software so there may be
bugs. Please report bugs by going 
<a class="report_bug" href="" target="_blank">here.</a> </p>

<a class="heading" id="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3></a>

<h4> ACTIVATING THE EXTENSION </h4>
<p>Type "dh" and hit the "tab" key in the browser bar to enter Deeper History search mode. Then type 
in search terms and Deeper History will search pages you have visited for those terms and return 
matching pages right there in your browser bar, just like google search.</p>

<h4> MULTI-TERM SEARCHING </h4>
<p>You can search for multiple terms at once by using a comma-separated list. For example, if you 
wanted to find pages in your history that had the words "json" and "phonegap API" you would activate 
the extension then type in "json, phonegap API"</p>

<h4> AUTO-COMPLETE </h4>
<p>There is also rudimentary auto-complete. Start typing a search term and all words in your database 
that begin with those letters will be returned. For example, if you activate the extension and type 
in "pho", anything in your databasas starting with "pho" (phone, phonegap, photon, etc.) would be 
returned. </p>

<p>This feature also works with a multi-term search. Using the above multi-term search example, you 
could type in "js,phon" and you would get back all pages that had the words "json, phonegap" as well 
as any other words starting those letters.  </p>

<h4> SELECTING A SEARCH RESULT </h4>
<p>Select one of those matches using your mouse or the up/down arrow keys then enter. On selection, 
Deeper History will take you to that page and highlight and scroll to the term you searched for.</p>

<h4> SEARCH TIME FRAME </h4>
<p>Currently, only the last 3 days of your history are searchable. Future releases will allow you to 
specify any search time frame. All of your history data is still stored. So you will be able to make 
use of all the history you have accumulated when those features are added. I'm the only person working 
on this so it takes time to get some of the more advanced features built, tested, and released. </p>

<h4> DELETE THE DATABASE </h4>

<p>Just remove the app from Chrome and all the site data you have accumulated will be removed 
permanently. Feature to let you do this while app is running is in the works.</p>

<h4> VIEWING THE  DATABASE </h4>

<p>Type "dh" and hit the "tab" key in the browser bar to activate the search functionality. Then 
type in ".db" and press "enter" and you will be taken to a page that displays data about what's 
stored in your Deeper History database.</p>

<h4>SCANNING YOUR PRE-EXISTING HISTORY </h4>

<p>Go to the <a href="options.html" target="_blank">OPTIONS PAGE</a> select how much of your browsing
history you want to scan and then press the "Scan" button. <br><br><b>IMPORTANT!!</b> Deeper History has to 
re-open the pages in your history to index the page contents. It will open a single tab and open a 
page from your history every 2 seconds. <b>We recommend performing the scan when you are away from the 
computer.</b> </p>

<a class="heading" id="faq"><h3>FAQ</h3></a>
<span class="question">I Just Installed This. Why Didn't I Get Any Results?</span>
<p class="answer">Deep History uses it's own history database so when it's first installed it hasn't
built any history to search yet. As you surf, pages will get added to the database and you will
start seeing results</p>

<p class="answer">You can have it perform a scan of your history by going to the <a href="options.html" target="_blank">OPTIONS PAGE</a></p>
